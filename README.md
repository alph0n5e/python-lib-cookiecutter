# Cookiecutter Template for Python Library

This project is a Cookiecutter template for Python 3 libraries.

Although the conventions chosen here reflect a lot of common good practices across the community, some are personal preferences based on my current experience with Python, and are probably not optimal for all use-cases.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) ~= 3.7 (i.e Python >= 3.7, < 4)
- [Cookiecutter](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/) Python package

## Usage
```
cookiecutter https://github.com/alph0n5e/python-lib-cookiecutter.git
```

See `cookiecutter --help` for generic Cookicutter options.
